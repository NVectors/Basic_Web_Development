# Learning Web Development
I attempted to learn web development via https://www.freecodecamp.org in the first half of 2020. However, I didn't enjoy the learning format and couldn't stay focus.<p>
I plan to learn the foundations of HTML/CSS/Javascript at [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Then I will switch over to the course at [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).  
This is a repo to stay organize and keep track of files related to my learning journey.
