        <h1>Image Format Page</h1>
        <p>This page covers the four common image formats used on the web (source: <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/#image-formats"> this page</a>).</p>

        <h2>JPGs</h2>
        <p>JPG images are good for photos especially those with lots of gradients but don't allow for trasnparent pixels.</p>

        <p>Scaling up the JPG image</p>
        <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="A mochi as a very large JPG image" width='275'>

        <h2>PNGs</h2>
        <p>PNG images are good for anything that's not a photo or animated.</p>
        <p>PNG images works well for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.</p>

        <p>Scaling up the PNG image</p>

        <h2>SVGs</h2>
        <p>SVG is a vector-based graphics format, the images can be scaled up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.</p>
        <P>This makes SVG images useful for <em>responsive design</em> and they have the same use case as a PNG image.</P>
        <p>There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, 
            you need to <strong>convert</strong> any text fields to outlines using your image editor. </p>

        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <p>GIFs are used for simple animations, they are limited in terms of color palette.</p>
        <p>Also the transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can't have semi-opaque pixels.
           This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background</p>
